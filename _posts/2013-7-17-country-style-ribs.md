If you want ribs, but you want something quick and easy, give some thought to trying country style ribs. They are not actually ribs at all though. Instead they come from a pork shoulder or butt that has been sliced in such a way that they look like traditional ribs. I have no idea why they are called country style though. Perhaps it is because they are not all uniform, kind of trashy, and crazy cheap. All I know, is that they are delicious.

Cooking them can be a little tricky. They can have a tendency to dry out, or dry out in certain spots, but not others. Any time you cook a pork shoulder, you want a low slow process and these country style ribs are no different. There are a few simple steps to take to try to prevent the meat from drying out though:

- Brine the ribs beforehand
- Keep your temperature steady
- Use INDIRECT heat

As far as flavor and/or sauce is concerned, I have found that using a liquid sauce is perhaps the easiest way to ruin a good meal. A good brown sugar rub can carmalize and combine with the rendering fat and create a great finger licking sauce on its own.

## Ingredients

- 5 lbs Country style ribs
- 1 cup (packed) Dark Brown Sugar
- 3 Tablespoon Paprika
- 2 Tablespoon Kosher Salt
- 1 Tablespoon Black Pepper
- 1 Tablespoon Galric Powder
- 1 teaspoon Dry Mustard

## Directions

1. Trim excess fat if there is any
2. Brined the ribs for 30 minutes in a 5% solution
3. Mix together the dry ingredients and create the rub
4. Coat the ribs thoroughly
5. Pack the ribs away in a large Ziploc bag and refrigerate overnight
6. Heat grill to 300 degrees
7. Push coals to one side of the grill
8. Lay the ribs out on the other side of the grill
9. Cook for about an hour
10. Target temperature should be 165 degrees
